# Brothers Keeper database parser/viewer/API
This library reads the Brothers Keeper 7.x database structure, parses it, and makes it available through an API. 

Currently, most of the data can be read and the most essential pieces are put into the API.

## Open issues
- Some parts of the database structure are still unclear to me. Let me know if you can help!
- Some data is not yet integrated into the API models.
